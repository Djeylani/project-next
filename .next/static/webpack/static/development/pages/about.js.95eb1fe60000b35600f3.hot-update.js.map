There are those, of course, who finds it natural to speak up, and those that finds it hard. The question, however, is that, which is to be asked: \"Will you speak up against your own best friend when they are wrongfully harming another life? Even if that life is human and not a dog?\"</p>\n        <p className=\"card-text text-center\">Contemplate upon that and think about it deeper before you answer.
